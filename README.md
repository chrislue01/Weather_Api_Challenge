# Weather_Api_Challenge




Background
Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they’ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data you’ve already retrieved in this module. Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

Overview
This analysis looks at different weather patterns around for different destinations and offers insights to travelers who want to book a trip. There are three folders with different analysis: weather database, vacation search, and vacation itinerary.


Weather Database
This folder uses Open Weather Map API to pull weather information on over 720 different cities around the world.


Vacation Search
This folder takes the information gained in the weather database and uses Google Maps API to plot different travel destinations with a hotel at each city. 


Vacation Itinerary
This folder takes the search information from the search folder and uses Google Maps directions API to create a vacation itinerary.
